# DAY 4 HOMEWORK
#
# Name:

# For this week's homework, the answer to each question should be a dataframe
# (tibble)

# 1. Load the "gapminder" dataset and save it to an object called gapminder
#
# HINT: This repo includes the gapminder.csv file in the data_raw folder
# HINT: I've written some of the code for you.

gapminder <-

# 2. Sort the data so that the country with the highest per capita GDP
# (gdpPercap) is at the top. Save the result to answer_2


# 3. Filter the gapminder data to the most recent year in the
# dataset, then select only the country and population columns. DO NOT use the
# pipe for this. Save the result to answer_3


# 4. Answer question 4 again, but this time USE the pipe (|>). Save the
# result to answer_4


# 5. Calculate the mean life expectancy for each country in
# Asia only. Save the result to answer_5
#
# HINT: use the combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()` to calculate
# a mean value by group
