# DAY 4 HOMEWORK
#
# Name:

# For this week's homework, the answer to each question should be a dataframe
# (tibble)

# 1. Load the data from gapminder.csv and save it to an object called gapminder
#
# HINT: This repo includes the gapminder.csv file in the data_raw folder
# HINT: You need to first load the tidyverse package before doing anything else


# 2. Sort the gapminder data so that the country with the highest per capita GDP
#    (gdpPercap) is at the top. Save the result to answer_2


# 3. Filter the gapminder data to the most recent year in the dataset, then
#    select only the country and population columns. DO NOT use the pipe for
#    this. Save the result to answer_3


# 4. Answer question 4 again, but this time USE the pipe (|>). Save the result
#    to answer_4


# 5. Calculate the mean life expectancy for each country in Asia only. Save the
#    result to answer_5
#
# HINT: use the combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()` to calculate
# a mean value by group
